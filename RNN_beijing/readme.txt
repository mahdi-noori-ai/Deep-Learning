Overview
This project aims to create a text generation model using an RNN. The model is trained on the Shakespeare dataset, which contains various works by William Shakespeare. The trained model can generate new text that mimics Shakespeare's writing style.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Tiny Shakespeare dataset provided by TensorFlow Datasets. It includes a collection of Shakespeare's works, allowing the model to learn from the patterns and structure of his writing.

Dataset Features
The dataset consists of raw text data, which is tokenized and converted into sequences of characters.
The target variable is the next character in the sequence, which the model learns to predict.
Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for training, the following preprocessing steps are applied:

Load and Prepare Text Data: The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow Datasets, and the text is extracted and processed.
Vocabulary Creation: A vocabulary of unique characters is created, mapping each character to an integer index.
Sequence Generation: The text is split into sequences of fixed length, which are used as input for the RNN.
Example of Preprocessing Code
python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
dataset, info = tfds.load('tiny_shakespeare', split='train', with_info=True)

# Convert the dataset to text
text = ''
for item in dataset:
    text += item['text'].numpy().decode('utf-8')

# Create a character vocabulary
vocab = sorted(set(text))
char2idx = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(vocab)}
idx2char = np.array(vocab)

# Convert text to integer representation
text_as_int = np.array([char2idx[c] for c in text])
Model Implementation
RNN Model
The RNN model is implemented using TensorFlow's Keras API. It consists of LSTM layers followed by a dense layer to predict the next character in the sequence.

Example of RNN Model Code
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Build the RNN model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(seq_length, len(vocab))),
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=True),
    Dense(len(vocab), activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

# Train the model
model.fit(dataset, epochs=20)
Results
The RNN model learns to generate text that resembles Shakespeare's writing. The generated text is evaluated based on its coherence and similarity to the original text.

Example of Results Visualization Code
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plot character frequency distribution
char_freq = {char: text.count(char) for char in vocab}

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x=list(char_freq.keys()), y=list(char_freq.values()))
plt.title('Character Frequency Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Character')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of RNNs for text generation, showcasing how deep learning models can learn and replicate complex patterns in text data. The trained model can generate realistic text that mimics the style of the Shakespeare dataset.
