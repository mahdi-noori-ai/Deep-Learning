This project demonstrates a comparison between Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models on a small dataset, achieving 100% accuracy for both approaches. The dataset used in this project contains information about cancer patients with the target variable indicating the level of severity (low, medium, high).

Overview
This project aims to compare the performance of a Random Forest classifier (ML) and a Neural Network (DL) on a small dataset. Both models achieved 100% accuracy, demonstrating the potential of both approaches in handling small datasets effectively.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a cancer patient dataset with various features and a target variable indicating the severity level (low, medium, high). The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Remove rows with missing values.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format.
Feature Scaling: Standardize the numerical features for better performance in models.
Models
Machine Learning Model
A Random Forest Classifier was used as the ML model.
Deep Learning Model
A Neural Network was used as the DL model.
Results
Both models achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.

Random Forest Accuracy: 100%
Neural Network Accuracy: 100%
Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates that both ML and DL models can achieve perfect accuracy on small, well-processed datasets. This highlights the importance of data preprocessing and the potential of both approaches in handling small datasets.
